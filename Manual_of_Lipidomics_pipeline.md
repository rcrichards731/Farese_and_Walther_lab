Manual of Lipidomics Pipeline
================
Wenting
2/21/2020





### Motivation

The laboratory of Drs. Robert Farese, Jr. and Tobias Walther at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Pulic Health has been using LipidSearch
software (version 4.1) for some time, currently we build a pipeline
based on Mass Spectrometry data processed by this software. We filtered
the data with flexible standards, did QC, statistics analysis and
visualization with extracted information from original txt file.

### Set up

  - Required R version 3.6.0 or later.  
  - For Mac users, XQaurtz must to be installed manually.  
  - Additional packages/libraries will be installed and uploaded
    automatically.
  - Pipeline will store all the output under 4 automatically generated
    directories: converted, data, plot,
plot/classes.

### Detailed review of pipeline steps:

Please note that pipeline will generate 2 folders: `plot` and `data`.
Under each folder, there will be corresponding subfolders, including
`QC`, `Quantification`, `Saturation`, `Length`, `Ether`, `Volc`.  
*Please note that for plot display, the data are collected from
different experiments.*  
User could also freely apply data in the fold `data` for different
plots.  
The standard input are case insensitive except for lipid classes and
group names.  
Mac users need to install Quartz manually before running pipeline.

##### Initialization:

  - Illustration: Convert txt file to csv file for consistent analysis
    and Run main script FWL\_lipidomics\_Version.R  
  - Utility: 
      To run the pipeline:
      - First, please download all the scripts in same directory as R
        project.  
      - Second, after click R project, please run script
        **txt\_to\_csv\_version.R** for converting raw txt file by
        typing *`source`* button, or type command
        *`source("txt_to_csv_version.R")`* in the console. Please note
        that, the converted csv files are stored in directory
        `converted`.  
      - Third, please go to the main script
        **FWL\_lipidomics\_version.R**. Press the *`source`* button, or
        type *`source("FWL_lipidomics_VERSION.R")`* in console.  
      - Fourth, when running the main script, make sure that Quartz is
        installed for mac users.

<!-- end list -->

``` r

```

    Are you using PC or MAC?
    Please type PC/MAC: MAC

``` 


Please make sure you installed Quartz before running pipeline.
          
Do you want to continue?
Please type Y/N: y
```

  - Useful short cuts: `cmd (ctr) + Enter` (run selected command), `cmd
    (ctr) + shift + c` (comment/uncomment).

##### Preprocess and Quality Check:

**(1) Read data**

  - Illustration: Console will list the files in the converted directory
    and will direct user with a command line asking user to input the index of
    the file for analysis.  
    <!-- - Code display: -->

  - Utility: Please input a number of file index. After input the file
    index, console will diplay the file you choose.  

  - Example display:

<!-- end list -->

    The following files had been generated. 
    Select ONE for subsequent the list of file names:
    1 030420_cGSL_mouse-brains_publication.csv
    2 10252019_PGRN_ctl-het-ko.csv

    Please input the index of the file: 8

    [1] "[1] converted/20171127_JC_Seipin.csv"

**(2) Check experiment samples**

  - Illustration: This part will check if any experiment sample will be
    excluded for analysis.  
    <!-- - Code Display: -->

  - Unitility: Please input Y or N (case insensitive).  

  - Example diplay:
    
      - When typing N, no samples are deleted for analysis.  
      - When typing Y, console will direct user with message below; user should then
        type the sample name. Please note that, the sample name has a
        fixed format: sample 1 should be written as s1 or S1. Sample numbers should be
        separated by a space.  
      - If you data are merged, we strongly suggestting deleting samples from other experiments. Otherwise, the data filtering
        standard will be influenced by other samples.

<!-- end list -->

``` 

Do you have experimental controls like internal standards or extraction control?

Please type Y/N: N
```

``` 

Do you have samples excluded for analysis which including experiment controls (internal standards)?


Please type Y/N: Y

Indicate which samples are controls or should be deleted from analysis
Sample ID , eg. s22 s23

option standards -----> s17 s18
```

##### **Quality Check**

Related data and plots will be under `QC` subfolders of `plot` and
`data`.

**(1) Set filter parameters**

  - Illustration: Filter the data based on user’s choice. Set flexible
    parameter k and j which depends on the experiment for total number
    of Grade A and B and APvalue.  
    Please note that Filter standard Rej = 0 will be automatically be
    applied. <!-- - Code display:  -->

  - Utility: Please input two corresponding numbers.  

  - Example display:

<!-- end list -->

``` 

Data are filtered using 3 criteria.  

 1. Not rejected by LipidSearch (Rej n=0); 
        
 2. Minimum number of Grade A+B required; 
        
 3. Minimum number significant identification (p-value p<=0.001) for LipidSearch standard.
        
 Filtered data are stored in the filtered.raw.data.csv.

Minimum number of identified molecules (Grade A+B) required in all samples, n>=3:

Minumum number of significantly identified lipids p<=0.001 in all samples, n>=3: 
```

**(2) Check background information**

  - Illustration: Plot the back ground information (sample blank)
    abundance in each detected lipid class. The plot will be saved as
    `background.png` in `plot` directory.

  - Output
example:

<img src="display/background.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**(3) Lipid Class Summary**

  - Illustration: there will be a table and plot for showing detected
    lipid class summary information. The plot and data will be saved as
    `prop_summary.png` and `proportion_classes.csv`.  
  - Output
example:

<center>

<img align="middle" src="display/prop_summary.png"  width="50%" height="50%"/>

</center>

**(4) Rention time analysis**

  - Illustration: The AUC value of all samples for each lipid class are
    log transformed. The plot is saved as `all_retention.png`.  
  - Output
example:

<img src="display/all.retention.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**(5) Mark odd chanins and test standard TG(17:1/17:1/17:1) abundance in
all samples**

  - Illustration:
      - Console will display the number of lipid molecules containing
        odd chains and their percentages. The odd chain lipid molecules are
        stored in `odd_chains.csv`.  
      - And for standard TG(17:171:17:1), if it is used, pipeline could
        detect its abundance in all samples and make a plot
        `TG17_all.png`. The standard can be replaced with standard from a future experiment.  
      - Please note that the bars are ordered by AUC value for each
        sample.
  - Example display:

<!-- end list -->

``` 

There are 157 lipid molecules contain odd chains. 
          
The odd chain of fatty acids percent is 24.04% in total.

The odd chain information is stored in odd_chains.csv.
```

<img src="display/TG17_all.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**(6) Fix duplicated lipid molecules**

  - Illustration: Pipeline will dectect same lipid molecules with
    different retention time and will filter the duplicates based on
    2 criteria. User will need to input criteria A or B (case
    insensitive). Duplicated lipid molecules will be under
    `duplicated.molecules.csv` and `diff_RT.csv`, reserved lipid
    molecules will be under `reserved_duplicates.csv`, and filtered data
    will be stored under `rm_duplicates.csv`.
      - Criteria A: use only ONE lipid molecule with largest AUC (Main
        Area Under Curve).  
      - Criteria B: Sum AUC for all duplicates.  
        `Please note that, method B will produce NA in some columns
        since soem values cannot be aggregated.`
  - Example display (when identical lipid molecules are present)

<!-- end list -->

``` 

!!!Attention: Identical lipid molecules with multiples retention time. Please note that the duplicate lipid molecules are stored in reserved_duplicates.csv 
 !!!!!! Potential sample contamination. 
 To PROCEED, pick one: 

Differences in retention time for identical lipid molecule are stored under diff_RT.csv

 A: Use only ONE lipid molecule with largest main area under curve, OR 
 B: Summation of main area under curve of ALL identical lipid molecule.

Filtered lipid molecules sans duplicates are stored under removeduplicates.csv
Enter 'A' or 'B': A
Filterted lipid molecules sans duplicates are stored under removeduplicates.csv
```

**(7) Input group information**

  - Illustration: User needs to input group information, i.e. experiment
    group names and its samples. Pipeline will extract sample AUC’s
    corresponding columns information. Group information will be stored
    in `group_information.csv`.
      - Please note that the group names will be asked for input in
        later analysis and will be *case sensitive*.  
      - Group number must be numerical; the sample naming format is
        consistent with previous example, e.g. s1 s2.  
      - Pipeline will ask if user want edit group information for
        correcting group information later.  
      - User can check group information under `group_information.csv`
  - Code display: The variable `label` in the code will be suffix in the
    genrated plot names and could be modified. Sample information
    for subsequent analyses can be re-edited after user typing Y in
    command line.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# pca and correlation plots
label <- "initial"
info_list <- PCA_pairs_Plot(sample_info, group_names, filtered_lipidomics2, label)
# check if deleting samples needed and plot new PCA
message("\nPlots can visualized under 'plot' directory or r studio plots panel.\nDo you want to edit sample information for subsequent analyses?")
pca_check <- retype_choice("Y/N")
info_list <- PCAcheck(pca_check, filtered_lipidomics2)

# making group repeats according to its position for making groups of later PCA
sample_raw_list <- info_list[[1]]
group_repeats <- info_list[[2]]
# make a data frame contains sample information and group information
group_info <- data.frame(samples=sample_raw_list, 
                         groups=group_repeats, 
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  group_by(groups) 
write_csv(group_info, "data/group_information.csv")
# variable store group names
group_names <- unique(group_repeats)
# variable store group number
ngroups <- length(group_names)
```

##### **Background Subtraction**

  - Illustration: Background subtraction or NOT will process the
    filtered data. If user chooses to use background subtraction, the
    data will subtract sample area from background/solvent run for later
    analysis. The previous filtered data will be stored in
    *filtered\_lipidomics\_copy* variable and `rm_duplicates.csv` in the
    previous step. The newly filtered data will be under
    `subtracted_lipids.csv`. After background subtraction, pipeline will
    provide 2 optional methods for fixing potential invalid lipid
    molecules. Method 1 will automatically delete lipid molecules which
    AUC are all negative or 0. Method 2 will ask user to delete
    potential invalid lipids in file `checkInvalid.csv` manually. Please
    note that `invalid.csv` is its copy and can be used for user reference. Console will then direct user with:
  - Utility:
      - Due to machine and other limitations, data could contain 0 or
        negative values. Pipeline will detect potential invalid value
        and calculate its sample size percentage information. Please
        check files `neg.percent.csv`, `checkInvalid.csv` or
        `invalid.csv`, `imputeNA.csv`.  
      - type 1 or 2  
  - Example display

<!-- end list -->

``` 

For lipid molecules that contain zero values or negative values (background subtracted): 
        
These values are subsequently replaced as non-valid values (NA). 
        
Fold change analyses is performed using only samples containing valid values
        
Please view file imputeNA.csv for all the data contains negative values after background subtraction.
        
Type 1 if you would like the pipleline to proceed with this function
        
Type 2 if you prefer to exlcude certain lipid molecules for fold change analysis
```

    - Method 1:

``` 

Please type 1/2: 1
        
The pipeline will first transform all the negative value into NA.
        
If negative percentage is over 50% in a group, all the values in the group for the molecule will be transformed into NA.
        
If a molecule which negative percentage is over 50% for all groups, it will then be deleted.
```

    - Method 2:

``` 

Please type 1/2: 2

Select 'checkInvalid.csv' to manually exclude specific lipid molecules and click SAVE.

If you have finished preprocessing the data, please continue and press Y: y
```

##### **Quantification Analysis**

Related data and plots will be under `Quantification` subfolders of
`plot` and `data`.

**(1) Quantification of total lipid classes (mean, sd)**

  - Illustration: Aggregate lipid molecules for same lipid class
    (`aggregated_class.csv, total_class.csv`) display mean and
    standard deviation for each experiment group. Please note that the
    data does not exclude negative values if user performs background subtraction.
  - Example
display:

<img src="display/total.class.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**(2) Quantification of individual lipid classes (mean, sd)**

  - Illustration: Visualize mean and standard deviation in each
    experiment group for individule lipid class (`all_lipidmolec.csv`).
    The plots will be splited by lipid class and bar number limitations
    of one page. And all the plots generated by `EachClassPlot` function
    are under folder `classes` in plot.  
  - Unitility:
      - Check the code below; the `nbar` variable (which can be
        modified) is set for the approximate maximum number of bars displayed in
        one plot. If you want display molecules of each lipid class in
        one page, please choose nbar as variable `lipidNO_max`.  
      - `post_name` variable is a common suffix name for plot and also
        can be modified.  
      - Please note that the function `EachClassPlot` for plotting
        may also be used for plotting other values like the median of the
        group. Correspondingly, the function `cal_lipid_statistics`
        could be used for calculating different demands, like mean, standard deviation,
        or other statistics. Please make sure these methods process
        the negative value properly, e.g. na.rm = TRUE.  
  - Code display:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# get mean data of each group for each lipid molecule
# you can also use median
group_par <- c("LipidMolec", "Class")
each_group_mean <- cal_lipid_statistics(filtered_lipidomics, group_info, "mean", group_par)
lipid_mean_wide <- each_group_mean[[1]]

**(3) Visualization of lipid class data, normalized by median**

  - Illustration: samples of each experiment group for lipid class are
    normalized (`raw_class_median.csv, normalized_class_median.csv,
    normalized_class_median_long.csv`) by median value of control group,
    and then median for each group is displayed as dot plot and box
    plot. If median value of lipid in control group is 0 or negative,
    the molecule will be deleted for foldchange analysis. User will need
    to input the control group name as comparison for fold change
    analysis.

<img src="display/class_median_dot.png" width="45%" /><img src="display/class_median_box.png" width="45%" />

**(4) Visualization of lipid molecule data, normalized by mean/median
value**

  - Illustration: Samples of lipid molecules are normalized by mean or
    median value. And corresponding mean or median value will be plot
    via bars. This visualization also implies `EachClassPlot` function,
    thus the plots are under classes, data are stored as
    `molecules_group_statics.cs, raw_molec.csv, normalized_molec.csv,
    normalized_molec_mean( or normalized_molec_median)` under
    Quantification of data folder. And there are two types of violin for
    display normalized data by choosing from mean or median as well. One
    violin (`molec_violin.png/svg`) will display all lipid class in one
    plot. One will only display the interactive customized lipid
    class(es) violin plot (`molec_violin_all.html`) to save time.  
    Please note that the interactive plots will display in teh `Viewer`,
    click panel `Plots` to view other plots.  
  - Example display: The first plot is normalized by mean, while second
    by median. The third one is violin plot, and only static voilin plot
    is showed in the manual
book.

<img src="display/PE.3_mean_in_CONTROL_HET_1.png" width="30%" /><img src="display/DG.1_median_in_control_het_1.png" width="30%" /><img src="display/molec_violin.png" width="30%" />

##### **Fatty Acids Saturation Analysis**

  - Illustration: This part will do analysis for Saturated fatty acids
    (`SFA`), Monounsaturated fatty acids (`MUFA`) and Polyunsaturated
    fatty acids (`PUFA`). All data from analysis will be under subfolder
    `Saturation`. And the data used for plotting are: `fa_mean.csv,
    fa_median.csv, fa_normalized_data.csv, fa_normalized_mean_long.csv`.
    Please note that the normalized data which control group mean value
    is 0 for foldchange will be deleted for analysis.  
    Please note that negative are transformed into NA after background
    subtraction and will be exclude for analysis.
  - Utility: User will need to input the control group name for
    normalizing data.  
  - Example display: The first statck plots used mean or median value of
    each group. And the third plot use the mean value of each group. The
    fourth plot use data which is normalized by the mean value of
    control group. And last plot shows the percentage for fatty acids
    saturation.

<img src="display/meanBased.stackplots.png" width="45%" /><img src="display/medianBased.stackplots.png" width="45%" /><img src="display/meanBased.fattyAcids.png" width="45%" /><img src="display/meanBased.fc.png" width="45%" /><img src="display/percentage.png" width="45%" />

##### **Fatty Acids Length Analysis**

  - Illustration: Fatty acid Length analysis will analyze the
    abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA),
    medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), and
    very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in each sample and group. All
    data and plots will under subfolder Length of folder data and
    plot.  
    There will be many plots names which have the suffix fc.png., meaning 
    that the fold change plot is customized by the user (which group should 
    be control, mean, or median for normalization).
    Many plots will display fold change analysis for
    individal chains (name end with fc.png). User will need to choose
    control group and normalization value mean or median or well. Please
    note that negative values are transformed into NA after background
    subtraction and will be excluded for analysis.
  - Example display: The first plot displays the different fatty acids
    length abundance in each sample. The second plot displays the
    percentage of different length in each sample. The third stack plot
    displays different length abundance in each group. The fourth plot
    displays the percentage of different length in each group. The fifth
    plot displays the different length abundance in each group. The sixth
    plot shows all the chains' fold change in PE lipid
class.

##### **Ether lipid analysis**

  - Illustration: This part will analyze ether lipid abundance in lipid
    class. The first 7 plots are ether lipids abundance analysis. The
    rest is combined with saturation analysis to find PUFA percentage in
    ether lipids. And all the data and plots are under subfolder Ether
    of data and plot.

  - Example
display:

<img src="display/ether.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/ether_percentage.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/ether_group.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/ether_group_percent.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/ether_abundance.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/ether_molec_abundance.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/normalized_ether_molec_abundance.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/pufa_ether.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/pufa_ether_percentage.png" width="40%" /><img src="display/pufa_ether_group.png" width="40%" />

##### **Impute Lipid Molecules for Differential Expression Analysis**

**(1) Test random sample distribution**

  - Illustration: one random sample will be log transformed and
    visualized its distribution. The note generated is just a reference
    and won’t be store. The log transformed data will be under
    `log.molec.csv`.  
  - Example display:

<img src="display/sample_distr.png" width="40%" />

**(2) Volcano plots**

  - Illustration: Volcano plots will generate 4 formats of same plot.
    The first plot will only display significant lipid molecules. The
    second plot will classify significant lipid molecules into
    glycerophospholipids, neutral lipids, sphingolipids, sterols and
    other lipids. The third plot is customized by the user, and it will onldy
    display the lipid class the user inputs from the lipid class list. The
    fourth plot will only mark significant ether lipids if they exist. Data
    and plots will be under subfolder Volc of data and plot.  
  - Utility: User will need to input times of contrast, group names for
    contrast, fold change threshold and customized lipid class(es).
    Please note that the group names need to be consistent with previous
    and separate by `vs` (or `VS`).  
  - Example display:

<!-- end list -->
